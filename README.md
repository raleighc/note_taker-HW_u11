## Description

This application allows the user to write and save notes that can be retrieved to view or delete later.

## Usage

The user can write, save, and delete notes with this application.
To begin the user can navigate to the home page where they will click the "Get Started" button to be directed to the notes page.

Once on the notes page, the user can enter a title and content of the note in the text fields provided.

After filling both fields with content, the user will see a save icon appear in the top right corned of the page which can be clicked to store their note.

After saving, the note will populate the section on the left side of the page where they will see the title of the saved note.

After notes have been saved they can be clicked to have the content populate the page. They can then click the pencil on the top right to start a new note or use the trashcan icons on the list of saved notes to delete that individual note.

## Creating This Page

For this project, I worked on creating and hosting an Express server on Heroku. The main challenges I faced were through getting all of the files to communicate with each other using express and requiring files instead of hard-coding links between files as we have for everything before now.
